# complement_generator Ver. 1.0

Hello! Yes, I just realized "complement" and "compliment" a different. Please do your best to ignore that blunder.

Anyway, here is a very simple compliment generator that reads compliments from a file and prints out a random one for you. This is version 1.0, so not a lot features thus far but if you need a pick me up, give it a try :). Or if you need to compliment someone fast, try it as well.
